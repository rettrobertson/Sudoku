# Sudoku
sudoku solver implementation in c#

the input file must be a text file following specific standards
first line: int - size of the grid, must be a perfect square
second line: set of characters seperated by spaces - representing the possible inputs for the sudoku puzzle, no multi-digit numbers, ex: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 a b c d e f g
following lines: grid of characters seperated by spaces - the '-' character represents empty spaces and other characters represent characters already filled in

note: the solution will be printed to the output file. If the input file is formatted correctly, the sudoku solver is hard coded to solve the example input I posted
